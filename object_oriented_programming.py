#Object Oriented Programming (OOP) : Object-Oriented Programming is an approach to programming that uses objects to model real-world entities.
#It involves modeling "things" in Python objects.


# #These objects can contain both data AND functiona all wrapped up together into
# reusable components.

# class are blueprints or recipes that we can later use to create objects from.
# A class describes what properties and functionality individual objects will contain.


# Instance - We call the individual objects that are created from a class blueprint instance.
